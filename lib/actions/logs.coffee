		Use this command to show logs for a specific device.

		By default, the command prints all log messages and exit.

		To continuously stream output, and see new logs in real time, use the `--tail` option.

		Note that for now you need to provide the whole UUID for this command to work correctly.

		This is due to some technical limitations that we plan to address soon.

		Examples:

			$ resin logs 23c73a1
			$ resin logs 23c73a1
